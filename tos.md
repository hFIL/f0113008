Thank you for choosing to host your files with us. We are making storage available by connecting to the  [Filecoin network](https://docs.filecoin.io/about-filecoin/what-is-filecoin/), which is designed to store files in a distributed fashion. As a node operator, we act as a host that stores files in exchange for filecoin tokens (FIL).

These Terms of Service (the "Terms") cover your use of our hosting services (the "Services"). You may use our hosting services only in accordance with these Terms. By using our Services, you agree to be bound to these Terms of Service and any other applicable policy documents, such as our Privacy Policy, and our Content Policy.

If you’re accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of someone else (such as another person or entity), you represent that you’re authorized to do so, and in that case the words “you” or “your” in these Terms include that other person or entity. In order to use the Services, you must be of legal age in your locale to do so.

### Definitions

A “node operator” (sometimes called a “storage miner”) is a Filecoin network participant that stores data on behalf of the network. They receive payments from clients that contract their services.

A “client” is someone who stores data on the Filecoin network.

### Your Files & Rights
When you make a deal with us on the Filecoin network, we agree to host files transferred from you (“Your Files”) for a specified time period, in exchange for a specified amount of FIL, in accordance with the rules and functionality of the Filecoin system. 

**Your Responsibilities**: By transferring files to our hosting system, you warrant that you have all necessary rights to store them on our system, and to use them in whatever manner you are using them. You also warrant that you will comply with all applicable local laws in your use of the Filecoin network, including that you will not store files with unlawful content.

**Limited License**: By uploading files to our hosting system, you grant us all rights necessary to provide the Services in accordance with these Terms, such as hosting, copying, transferring, processing, and backing up files. This permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with. These Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Files except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.

**Content Policy**:  We may review your Files for compliance with these Terms and the Content Policy set forth in this section, and reserve the right to deny storage of, disable access to, or delete, any violating content, including any content alleged or determined to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, that constitutes or facilitates dangerous or malicious software, code or functionality, contains child sexual abuse material (“CSAM”) or terrorist or violent extremist content (“TVEC”), or otherwise violate relevant laws, regulations or the rights of others. If you have stored Your Files with us and they violate the content policy, We can delete such files and may still be able to keep some of the FIL you paid for the storage, in line with the Filecoin protocol.

To the extent we operate hosting services with operations based in the People’s Republic of China, other categories of content that may violate our policy include content that violates the basic principles of the PRC constitution; endangers national security, divulges state secrets, subverts state authority and impinges upon national unity; damages the honor and interests of the state; incites hatred and discrimination and undermines unity among different ethnicities; undermines the state's religious policy and propagates cult and feudal superstition; spreads rumors and disturbs social order and stability; spreads obscenity, pornography, gambling, violence, murder, terror or abetting crimes; insults or slanders others and infringes upon legitimate rights and interests of the others; or contents that are otherwise prohibited by the laws and administrative regulations of the state.

We reserve the right to decline further transactions with repeat infringers or parties who engage in activities that violate these Terms or any aspect of this Content Policy.

The Services are provided “as is.” We also disclaim any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.** Some places don’t allow these types of disclaimers, so they may not apply to you.

### Limitation of Liability
**In countries where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed, We won’t be liable for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or special damages, or any loss of use, data or profits, under any legal theory, even if We have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
